			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>Furniture Assist started out in 2004 as a tiny outreach of St. Luke and All Saints Episcopal Church in Union, NJ, but has grown into a full-fledged Non-Profit Corporation that aids 15 clients a week. Since becoming an official non-profit in 2006, we have become active helpers in the outreach efforts of over 100 organizations. Thanks to the help of thousands of families, we have assisted thousands of clients.</p>
			
			<p>But we can grow much more, even while staying in our <a href="find.htm">24 Commerce Street, Springfield</a> location. Furniture Assist has the current capacity to aid 60 to 90 clients a week, but is limited by the number of volunteers and donations. With your help, we can make a real change in the community we all share.</p>
