			<h1>Referring a Client</h1>
			<p>If your agency is already approved and is ready to refer a client, please use the following procedure:
				<ol>
					<li>Complete and fax to us the client referral form. Within a few weeks, we will fax to you a signed form with an appointment date.</li>
					<li>Inform the client of the appointment date, provide them with a printed copy of our procedures, and give them directions to our distribution center.</li>
					<li>Contact us if the client is not available for their assigned appointment date.</li>
					<li>Ensure that the client understands that:
						<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
						<li>They will only be admitted on the day and time of their appointment.</li>
						<li>Young children are not allowed, and must be left home.</li>
						<li>Furniture is distributed on a first-come, first-serve basis, within reason.</li>
						<li>We cannot store furniture for later pick-up.</li>
						<li>There is no guarantee that we will have any given item. High demand items like beds are in short supply.</li>
						<li>If the client is going to miss an appointment, they must call us before their scheduled arrival time.</li>
						<li>It may be a few weeks before the client receives an appointment date.</li>
						</ul>

You must bring your own transportation and bags for the clothes. Clothes distributions are made by appointment only. Don't bring clients when you re-stock your closet.
